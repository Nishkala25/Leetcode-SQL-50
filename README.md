L# LeetCode SQL 50 Questions: Databricks Notebook Solutions (SQL & PySpark)

Welcome to my LeetCode SQL 50 Questions repository! This project showcases my solutions to LeetCode's top 50 SQL questions, implemented in Databricks notebooks. Each notebook contains both SQL and PySpark solutions, allowing me to practice data manipulation techniques in both languages.

## Overview

- **Platform:** LeetCode SQL Questions
- **Tools Used:** Databricks, SQL, PySpark
- **Goal:** Strengthen SQL and PySpark DataFrame skills through practical data challenges
- **Repository Structure:** Each notebook is self-contained, with solutions in both SQL and PySpark for comparison and learning.

## Repository Structure

- **`/notebooks`**: Contains Databricks notebooks, each corresponding to a LeetCode question.
    - **Naming Convention:** Notebooks are named based on the question number and title for easy reference.
    - **Content:** Each notebook includes a question prompt, SQL solution, and PySpark DataFrame solution.

## Contents

This repository will cover key SQL and PySpark concepts, including but not limited to:
- Joins
- Group By and Aggregation
- Window Functions
- Filtering and Sorting
- Data Cleaning and Transformation

## Usage

To view the solutions:
1. Open the `notebooks` folder.
2. Click on any notebook file to view the SQL and PySpark solutions side-by-side for each question.
3. Use the Databricks platform or Jupyter Notebook to run these notebooks interactively.

## Progress

I am committed to regularly updating this repository with my solutions to LeetCode's SQL challenges. Follow along to track my progress!
